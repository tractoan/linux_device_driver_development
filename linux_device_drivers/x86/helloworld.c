/*
The main goal of threaded IRQs is reducing the time spent with interrupts disabled to a
bare minimum. With threaded IRQs, the way you register an interrupt handler is a bit
simplified. You does not even have to schedule the bottom half yourself. The core does that
for us. The bottom half is then executed in a dedicated kernel thread. We do not use
request_irq() anymore, but request_threaded_irq()
	int request_threaded_irq(unsigned int irq, irq_handler_t handler,\
							irq_handler_t thread_fn, \
							unsigned long irqflags, \
							const char *devname, void *dev_id)
		@handler function: This is the same function as the one registered with
	request_irq(). It represents the top-half function, which runs in an atomic
	context (or hard-IRQ). If it can process the interrupt faster so that you can get rid
	of the bottom half at all, it should return IRQ_HANDLED. But, if the interrupt
	processing needs more than 100 Î¼s, as discussed previously, you should use the
	bottom half. In this case, it should return IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, which will result in
	scheduling the thread_fn function that must have been provided.
		@thread_fn function: This represents the bottom half, as you would have
	scheduled in your top half. When the hard-IRQ handler (handler function)
	function returns IRQ_WAKE_THREAD, the kthread associated with this bottom half
	will be scheduled, invoking the thread_fn function when it comes to run the
	ktread. The thread_fn function must return IRQ_HANDLED when complete.
	After being executed, the kthread will not be rescheduled again until the IRQ is
	triggered again and the hard-IRQ returns IRQ_WAKE_THREAD
